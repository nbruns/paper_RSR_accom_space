# paper_RSR_accom_space
Repository for mansucript assessing how ecogeomorphic feedbacks mediate the impact of shifts in root to shoot ratio carbon accumulation in coastal marshes.
Base model, baseline_model_drowning_DYNAMIC_RSR.cpp, is the model developed for and used to produce the figures in:
Kirwan, Matthew L., and Simon M. Mudd. “Response of Salt-Marsh Carbon Accumulation to Climate Change.” Nature 489, no. 7417 (September 2012): 550–53. https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11440.
